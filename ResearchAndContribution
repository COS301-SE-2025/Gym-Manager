# Research Background & Contribution

Our research process combined **client collaboration**, **domain exploration**, and **technical investigation** to ensure that the **TrainWise system** was both user-centred and technically robust. This multi-faceted approach enabled the alignment of product functionality with real-world operational needs while maintaining a foundation in applied software engineering research.

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Client & Domain Research

Early in the project, we conducted multiple collaborative sessions with our industry client to develop a clear understanding of:

- How **HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)** gyms operate.  
- The **workflow** between managers, coaches, and members.  
- How **sessions** are structured, scheduled, and tracked in actual gym environments.  

These insights directly influenced the app‚Äôs user flow and feature prioritization, ensuring that functionalities such as booking, scheduling, and live session tracking reflected authentic HIIT gym practices.

In addition, we performed **independent domain research** into HIIT methodologies, focusing on:
- **Session structures** such as AMRAP, EMOM, and Tabata formats.  
- **Timing mechanisms** and **performance tracking principles**.  

This research shaped the design of our **workout builder**, **leaderboard systems**, and the overall session logic. The result was an application experience specifically optimized for the tempo and competitiveness characteristic of HIIT training environments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Research

Parallel to the domain research, continuous technical investigation was undertaken to validate and refine implementation strategies for core system features. This included:

- Integration with **Apple HealthKit** for wearable data synchronization.  
- **Real-time communication models** for live leaderboard updates and session synchronization.  
- Extensive consultation of **technical documentation** for frameworks and tools such as React, React Native, Supabase, and Drizzle ORM.  

This technical research ensured adherence to **best practices in mobile application development**, **secure data handling**, and **scalable backend architecture**, supporting a reliable and maintainable system foundation.

## üéØ Research Contribution

The TrainWise project contributes to applied research in **interactive fitness systems**, **gamified training environments**, and **multi-tenant SaaS architecture**. Its innovative components highlight how software engineering research can enhance engagement, motivation, and scalability in digital fitness ecosystems.

1. **Real-Time Live Classes**  
   A custom-built live session engine synchronizes timers, scores, and activity updates across participants in real time. This dynamic system transforms workouts into interactive, competitive experiences that emulate the energy of in-person classes.

2. **Remote & Hybrid Fitness Futures**  
   The same infrastructure powering in-gym live sessions is adaptable for remote or hybrid formats. By integrating video streaming APIs or real-time video calling, gyms can host online HIIT sessions, broadening accessibility and introducing new business opportunities.

3. **Wearable & Health App Integration**  
   Through Apple Health integration, the platform collects and analyzes telemetry such as **heart rate** and **calorie data**, linking in-gym performance to broader health metrics. This supports a more comprehensive view of individual fitness progress.

4. **Gamification for Motivation and Retention**  
   Features such as **badges**, **streaks**, **leaderboards**, and **reactive avatars** promote consistent engagement. These design elements align with research in behavioural psychology, reinforcing motivation and community interaction.

### Additional Research-Driven Features

1. **Tailored HIIT Experience**  
   Unlike generic fitness applications, TrainWise is purpose-built for HIIT training. Its class creation, timing, and scoring systems are directly aligned with the rhythm, pace, and competitiveness of HIIT workouts.

2. **Advanced Analytics**  
   The system delivers both **member performance analytics** (progress trends, attendance rates) and **business intelligence** (class popularity, coach activity). These insights enable continuous improvement and data-informed decision-making for both users and gym operators.

3. **Multi-Gym Scalability**  
   Although currently implemented for single-gym use, the architecture is designed for **multi-tenant scalability**. This approach supports future global deployment across multiple gyms sharing a unified backend infrastructure.

## üåç Broader Impact 

The **HIIT Gym Manager project** demonstrates how **research-informed software design** can transform conventional gym management into a **data-driven, gamified, and scalable digital fitness ecosystem**. By bridging multiple disciplines‚Äîincluding **fitness science**, **behavioural psychology**, **data analytics**, and **distributed systems**‚Äîthe system establishes a model for future innovations in interactive fitness technology. Its success lies in uniting human-centred design with technical rigor to deliver measurable impact in both industry and research contexts.
