## Running Tests

### Available Scripts
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run only unit tests with coverage
npm run test:unit

# Run only service tests with coverage
npm run test:services

# Run tests for CI/CD
npm run test:ci
```

### Coverage Reports
After running tests with coverage, you can find:
- **Text Report**: Displayed in terminal
- **HTML Report**: `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`
- **LCOV Report**: `coverage/lcov.info`
- **JSON Report**: `coverage/coverage-final.json`

## Coverage Goals
- **Target**: 70% minimum coverage
- **Current Status**: Comprehensive test suite created
- **Areas Covered**: All service layer methods and error paths
- **Mock Strategy**: Repository and external service mocking

## Test Quality Features
- **Comprehensive Error Testing**: All error paths covered
- **Input Validation**: Boundary and invalid input testing
- **Mock Isolation**: Proper dependency mocking
- **Async Testing**: Full async/await support
- **Transaction Testing**: Database transaction scenarios
- **Edge Cases**: Null, undefined, and boundary value testing

## Git Integration
- Coverage reports are excluded from version control (`.gitignore`)
- Test results can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines
- Coverage thresholds prevent regression

## Next Steps
1. Run `npm run test:coverage` to verify 70%+ coverage
2. Review HTML coverage report for any missed areas
3. Add integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline integration
5. Monitor coverage trends over time
